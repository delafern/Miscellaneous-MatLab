Random MatLab scripts doing fun things or giving examples of neat functions

Here is a script developed for Oregon State Rocketry teams to make aluminum or titanium nosecone tips for their rockets.
The user simply fills out the form and the GCODE is automatically generated into a text file which can be interpreted as GCODE by a CNC lathe.
The final product:

Plot points from the mandelbrot set - code was a very early attempt and lacking in a lot of ways, BUT was fun to do for someone very new to writing code at the time.

Here I just create a few cylinders and run a simple steady state haet transfer analysis - I believe this was a MATLAB tutorial but I repeated the process with a simple model of a motor I created. The process in question is importing an stl, making a thermal pde, identifying the faces and assigning their thermal conductivity, and then solving the pde.
